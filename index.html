<h1>Can you spot the phish?</h1>
<div>
Can you tell which domains are from example.com, and which are not?<br>
  This is a self-paced test to see if you can find the spoofed domains.<br><br>
  <h3>How to play</h3>
  Look over each domain one-by-one.<br>
  If the is example.com, www.example.com, or secure.example.com, it is legitimate. <br>
  Once you have decided if it is phish check the checkbox.<br>
  If it turns green, it was legit.<br>
  If it turns red, it was phish.<br>
  Don't feel bad if you miss one; many of these have extremely small or hard to spot differences.<br>
